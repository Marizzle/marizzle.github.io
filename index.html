                                    As a Spotify addict, something I've always been wanting to get around to doing was visualize
                                    my listening habits. I started using Spotify in the August of 2012 and since them I've listened
                                    to over 18,000 songs! Clearly this was a dataset that I just could not ignore!

                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    One of the main issues I had to tackle first was figuring out a way to siphon out the data from
                                    a source. I came up with a solution which I'll be posting once I'm done with this visualization
                                    and a tutorial for how you can get the data yourself and start visualizing your own listening
                                    habits!

                                    This was the final project my group and I worked on for ECS 163 (Information Interface. My partners
                                    for this assignment were William Baron and Irum Sattar (I'll link their profiles at the end). We decided
                                    to divide the effort into three parts and I was responsible for the Map Interface while William worked on
                                    the Country Statistics Interface and Irum worked on the Country Matchup Interface. This was and probably
                                    still is the largest visualization project I had the pleasure of working on and in the end I was quite
                                    happy with the result.
                                </p>
                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    Gathering the data was one of the more difficult aspects for this project as there was data available online
                                    but it was not in the format that we would have liked so what we did was generate our own dataset using the information
                                    we pulled from online sources to fit our needs. I'm glad William was part of of the group as he managed the bulk of the
                                    data gathering operation. Irum held her own as well and pulled off an awesome interface for the Country Matchup section.

                                    For the implementation of the map I was very glad that we were using Processing as it made the task much
                                    easier to accomplish with the knowledge I had at the time. We were given the option to use any library to implement
                                    the visualization and at the time we were only exposed to D3.js and Processing. We were all more used to the Java
                                    way of thinking and so we decided to choose Processing as the library of choice.
                                </p>

                                    This was the second project for ECS 163 (Information Interfaces) and was the first one to involve partners. My partner
                                    for this assignment was Rutvi Kotak (link below!) and this project was the first that exposed us both to Processing.
                                    We both had experience with Java before this assignment so working with Processing made things relatively easier than
                                    with D3.js, the library we had to use for the first project in ECS 163. I was quite glad that I had taken ECS 175 (Computer Graphics)
                                    before this class as it made things easier for me to think of how to do things like animations and such using Processing since working
                                    with Processing was a bit like working with OpenGL only a bit less complicated. For example, the draw() method in Processing is analogous
                                    to the GLpaint method in openGL.
                                </p>
                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    This project underwent a variety of changes in terms of structures. Both Rutvi and I had a variety of wild and crazy
                                    ideas for how we wanted to visualize the data set, many of which were awesome but the real difficulty here was time.
                                    Simply put we didn't have enough time to implement every possible thing we would have wanted, but we were both very
                                    happy with what we were able to accomplish at the end. You'll be able to see some of the drastic changes as the project
                                    progressed below!
                                </p>
                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    Much of the creativity can be attributed to Rutvi as she was the one to suggest using the Handy library for this project
                                    which helped make our project really stand out among all the others (we managed to get extra credit on this one!). One of the
                                    things I really liked working on was the overall UI of the visualization. Most of the components for this project were made from
                                    scratch with the aid of Handy for giving it that cartoony like aesthetic. This was quite fun as it proved to be different from
                                    any of the other assignments I've worked on prior.

                            <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                This was the first project given in ECS163 (Information Interfaces) which required us to visualize a dataset
                                compiled from Unitrans. The dataset included the bus line, the bus stop, the date and time, and the number
                                of people who boarded and deboarded the bus at that particular stop. The main requirement for this assignment
                                was D3.js, the first of the two major visualization libraries covered in the course. This assignment was pretty
                                straightforward as I had experience with web development which proved to be an advantage as a large chunk of the class
                                had no prior experience with it.
                            </p>
                            <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                I can consider this my first "real" visualization and it was definitely an experience. There was definitely a big
                                learning curve for D3 and as such I spent a good chunk of my time looking at examples and toying around with some
                                thought experiments which helped me develop an understanding of how to use it. Again, because it was my first
                                visualization there are a lot of areas which looking back could have been improved upon and I would have liked to
                                have done more but the final product is functional. It was much easier to make beautiful looking interfaces given
                                all the libraries available for web development which make making the layout a lot easier.
                            </p>

                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    Hey! My name is Mario Yepez-Olvera and I'm currently an undergrad at the Univeristy of California, Davis.
                                    I am also an Undergraduate Researcher at the Institute for Data Analysis here at UC Davis working on various
                                    projects which involve Computer Vision and to some extent Visualizations.
                                    I'll be entering my fourth and final year come this Fall as a Computer Science and Engineering major with the
                                    prospects of going into graduate school (or maybe not depending on where life takes me).
                                </p>
                                <h3>What I Am About:</h3>
                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    As you can tell after browsing through this site, I am a HUGE fan of visualizing data! Be it scientific, or
                                    information I'm super excited to work on projects which involve some sort of data analysis! After taking ECS 175
                                    (Computer Graphics) with Ken Joy, my interest in Computer Graphics grew. It was one of the motivating reasons why
                                    I asked him for research after completing his class! The next logical step was to take the course on Information
                                    Interfaces (ECS 163) which focuses heavily on the fundamentals of user interfaces and information visualization.
                                    This is where I knew that visualization datasets was the thing for me!
                                </p>
                                <p class="indented" align="justify">
                                    I'd like to thank you for taking your time to visit this site as it means a lot to me. Feel free to contact me for
                                    suggestions, inquiries, or to just give feedback (or some data sets if you're feeling generous! I welcome it.
